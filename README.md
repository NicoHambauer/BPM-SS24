# Business Process Management - Predictive Process Modeling

This repository is part of the lecture Business Process Management at University of Leipzig in behalf of Prof. Dr. Patrick Zschech

In this session the material belongs to, we talk about Predictive Process Modelling (PPM) also referred to as Predictive Business Process Monitoring (PBPM), in particular about:

* Event Log Data Exploration
* Data Preprocessing and Encoding
* Naive approaches using a Bayes Classifier with a context window of **1 activity**. This is a conditional probability approach
* Simple approaches using Bayes, DT, RF with the entire activity sequence window. This approache includes positional encoding via a one-hot encoding.
* Modern approaches using RNNs including the preprocessing for that.
